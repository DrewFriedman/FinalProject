## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the impact of Immigration on the economic growth of a country. Today immigration is used a a political tool to create division and to distinguish the ideology of various political parties across the world. Despite the frequent criticism surrounding the impact of migrants on a countries crime and violence rate, there is statistical evidence to convey that immigration can have a positive impact on a countries economic growth. Moreover, there could also be data to support that there is no correlation between a rise in immigration and an increase in crime. 



##Research Question:
Does immigration have a positive impact on a country’s economy?
##Hypothesis: 
Immigration positively impacts a country’s economy by increasing labor market flexibility, fostering innovation, and filling labor shortages. According to economic theory, immigration boosts economic output by increasing the size of the labor force, raising productivity, and fostering diversity that enhances creativity and innovation. The positive economic contributions of immigrants are often seen in sectors requiring both high and low-skilled labor, leading to a more dynamic economy.
This hypothesis is supported by behavioral economic theory, which posits that immigrants tend to be entrepreneurial and adaptable, often contributing disproportionately to industries that drive economic growth. Additionally, institutional theories suggest that countries with strong economic and political structures can better absorb immigrant labor, making these nations more likely to see positive economic outcomes from immigration.
##Explanatory Variables of Interest:
The main explanatory variable is immigration rates, which could be measured as the annual number of immigrants per capita or as a percentage of the population. This variable needs to exhibit variation across different countries and time periods to assess its impact on the economy effectively. Data sources for this might include government immigration statistics or international databases such as the World Bank or the OECD.
Secondary explanatory variables could include type of immigrants (i.e., high-skilled vs. low-skilled), measured through education levels or occupational categories, as well as integration policies that measure how well immigrants are integrated into the workforce.
##Outcome Variable of Interest:
The outcome variable is economic performance, typically measured through GDP growth, employment rates, or labor productivity. GDP per capita, in particular, provides a good indicator of the overall economic impact, capturing how the economy adjusts to an increasing population. Alternatively, the impact on wages and unemployment rates for native workers can also be included to measure broader economic effects.
#3Observed Patterns Supporting the Hypothesis:
A positive relationship between immigration rates and GDP growth would support the hypothesis. Specifically, if countries with higher immigration rates consistently exhibit higher GDP growth, employment rates, and productivity gains, it would suggest that immigration contributes positively to the economy.
##Observed Patterns Disproving the Hypothesis:
A negative or no correlation between immigration rates and economic growth, or evidence of increasing unemployment or wage stagnation among native-born workers, would disprove the hypothesis. If the data show that higher immigration correlates with negative economic outcomes like a decrease in GDP growth or increasing income inequality, this would challenge the view that immigration has a broadly positive economic impact.


## Having signifcant trouble loading and Using my data sets. Pulled one data set on World Bank GDP per capita per year and one Data set from the OECD on inflow on immigrants per year. Tried to merge data sets, join them to make sure countries are consisent, all of which did not work. I cannot even use read.csv function. Will reach out for extra help but have not be able to find a solution otherwise. Both data sets were uploaded via EXcel.
