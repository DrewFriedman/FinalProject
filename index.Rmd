## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the impact of Immigration on the economic growth of a country. Today immigration is used a a political tool to create division and to distinguish the ideology of various political parties across the world. Despite the frequent criticism surrounding the impact of migrants on a countries crime and violence rate, there is statistical evidence to convey that immigration can have a positive impact on a countries economic growth. Moreover, there could also be data to support that there is no correlation between a rise in immigration and an increase in crime.
